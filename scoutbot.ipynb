      " 1. **Brendan McKay — 1B (2019)**\n",
      "   - **Starter Argument**: McKay has shown above-average to plus command with a low-to-mid-90s fastball and a plus-flashing curveball, suggesting he has No. 2 or 3 starter upside. His development as a pitcher has been strong, and he was seen as a first-round talent for both hitting and pitching.\n",
      "   - **Reliever Argument**: His usage might be similar to Shohei Ohtani's, indicating he could be handled as a standout, playoff rotation-caliber starter and DH, but there's a chance he could also be valued more for his pitching, potentially leading to a mid-rotation profile rather than a full-time starter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tanner Dodson — OF (2019)**\n",
      "   - **Starter Argument**: Dodson is a plus-running switch-hitter with good barrel control and was drafted as a two-way player, indicating teams see potential for him to contribute significantly in both hitting and pitching roles.\n",
      "   - **Reliever Argument**: His pitching stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever, and while he has skills as a hitter, neither role projects to be one of impact, suggesting he may end up as a utility player rather than a starter in either capacity. \n",

      "**2019 Catching Prospects:**\n",
      "- **Offensive Approach:**\n",
      "  - Joey Bart: Plus raw power, good bat speed, but elevated strikeout rates and okay pitch selection.\n",
      "  - Alex Jackson: Plus plus raw power, but inconsistent hitting and high strikeout rate (over 30%).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Defensive Skills:**\n",
      "  - Joey Bart: Above average defensive tools, exceptional behind the plate, strong game calling and preparation.\n",
      "  - Alex Jackson: Improved receiving skills, strong arm, but blocking remains a work in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Athleticism:**\n",
      "  - Joey Bart: Noted for athleticism and ability to slow the game down defensively.\n",
      "  - Alex Jackson: Less athleticism compared to earlier years, more of a power-only backup profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2013-2015 Catching Prospects:**\n",
      "- **Offensive Approach:**\n",
      "  - Chris Okey: Lacks a carrying tool but has potential for average offensive output (.260 with 15 homers).\n",
      "  - Will Smith: Solid tools with a history of adjustments leading to improved hitting in Double-A.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Defensive Skills:**\n",
      "  - Chris Okey: Average catch-and-throw skills, good instincts on the bases, but no standout defensive tool.\n",
      "  - Will Smith: Quick feet and solid arm strength, excelling defensively with a high caught-stealing rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Athleticism:**\n",
      "  - Will Smith: Better athlete than most catchers, capable of playing other positions.\n",
      "  - Chris Okey: More athletic than typical catchers, but overall athleticism not as emphasized as in 2019 prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2019 prospects, particularly Bart and Jackson, emphasize raw power and advanced defensive skills, with Bart showcasing exceptional athleticism. In contrast, the 2013-2015 prospects like Okey and Smith focus more on average offensive tools and solid defensive skills without standout athleticism. \n",
